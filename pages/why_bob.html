  <h1>Why Bob?</h1>
  <p>Some of the (non exhaustive) reasons of why Bob</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use GPL and be FOSS</li>
    <li>
      Have a very small core with a limited feature set. And be opinionated ONLY about them.
      <ul>
        <li>Steps (direct commands like shell)</li>
        <li>Pipeline (Collection of steps which can consume artifacts from other pipelines)</li>
        <li>Environment (Key value store associated with either steps and/or Pipelines)</li>
        <li>Resources (Things like source code or artifacts produced by pipelines)</li>
        <li>Artifacts (Something built by a Pipeline)</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Expose the above feature set entirely via an API, hence allow any client to configure/control it. Also not be
      affected by bugs in it.</li>
    <li>Be agnostic of an UI</li>
    <li>Be more extensible than great things like Concourse.ci</li>
    <li>Accept the above stuff via an YAML as well</li>
    <li>Build pretty much everything else external resources or orchestrate via API</li>
    <li>Scale via multiple federated bob instances(think Cassandra) and share loads and resources</li>
  </ul>
